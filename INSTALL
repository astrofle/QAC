QAC only makes sense to use it within CASA, so you will need to have
this installed first. See https://casa.nrao.edu/casa_obtaining.shtml

We currently do not recommend anything before CASA version 5.0 

After CASA has been installed, the installation of QAC is very simple.
You can either manually load the appropriate python file(s) using
python's execfile() function, for example 

	 execfile('qac.py')
	 execfile('tp2vis.py')

will get you the basic QAC functions. 


However, it is far more convenient to automate this for each time you
load CASA.  For this, copy the contents of the casa.init.py into your
~/.casa/init.py but modify the location of your personal qac_root,
or use a symlink where this was installed on your system.

For example, the following commands would work just fine:


    cd ~/.casa
    git clone https://github.com/teuben/QAC
    cat casa.init.py >> ~/.casa/init.py

The next time CASA starts, you will see the QAC routines are loaded.


FUTURE:
-------

In the current CASA environment there are two other ways QAC could be
installed:
 
- the "buildmytasks" method (supposedly deprecated?)
- the "setup.py" method (e.g. ADMIT uses this)

but none are supported in this development version of QAC. They might
be in some future release, depending on further development of CASA.
As it stands now, using the execfile() style to load the correct files
is the more pragmatic approach.
