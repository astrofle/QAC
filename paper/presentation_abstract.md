## Short Spacing Configurations for Full Flux Recovery with the ngVLA

The​ ​ next​ ​ generation​ ​ Very​ ​ Large​ ​ Array​ ​ will​ ​ provide​ ​ unprecedented​ ​ resolution​ ​ and​ ​ sensitivity​ ​ at radio​ ​ frequencies​ ​ from​ ​1 to​ 115​ ​ GHz. Like any interometric array, the ngVLA will not cover all possible baselines and thus it will be limited in its ability to recover the true flux for all observed spatial scales. 

We present a detailed study of simulations carried out of various short spacing antennae configurations including large single-dish and closely packed compact array total power options. We discuss the benefits of the short-spacing configurations for mapping Milky Way extended emission, nearby galaxies, and probing high dyanmic range fields. The simulations make use of Quick Array Combinations (QAC) derived from the TP2VIS project.
