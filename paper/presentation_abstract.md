# Presentation Abstract

## Short Spacing Configurations for Full Flux Recovery with the ngVLA

The​ ​ next​ ​ generation​ ​ Very​ ​ Large​ ​ Array​ ​ will​ ​ provide​ ​
unprecedented​ ​ resolution​ ​ and​ ​ sensitivity​ ​ at radio​ ​ frequencies​ ​
from​ ​1 to​ 115​ ​ GHz. Like any interferometric array, the ngVLA will not
cover all possible baselines and thus it will be limited in its
ability to recover the true flux for all observed spatial scales.

We present a detailed study of simulations carried out by adding
various short spacing antennae configurations (large single-dish and
closely packed compact array) to the interferometric data. We discuss
the benefits of the short-spacing configurations for mapping Milky Way
extended emission, nearby galaxies, and probing high dyanmic range
fields. The simulations make use of the Quick Array Combinations (QAC)
CASA add-on derived from the TP2VIS project.

simulated observations make use of the newly devleoped Quick Array
Combinations (QAC) CASA add-on derived from the TP2VIS project. We
discuss the workflow for using QAC to generate simulated ngVLA 
observations of Milky Way extended emission and nearby galaxies.
